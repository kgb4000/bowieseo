                  <p>
                    We're not like other SEO companies in B'more that only show
                    up at the end of the month when it's time to get paid. We
                    don't hide anything from you. We keep you informed and in
                    the loop about everything we do. You'll never have to ask
                    what we're doing because you'll always know.

                  <h3>No Long-term Contracts</h3>
                  <p>
                    We do monthly retainers, not long-term contracts. If you
                    want to stop at the end of the month, just let us know. We
                    understand that committing to an SEO campaign can be a big
                    step for a small business, but think about this. It can take
                    anywhere from three to twelve months to see any improvements
                    in your SEO performance.

                    great thing is that when you grow, we grow with you. We
                    don't base our decisions on flimsy indicators like the
                    number of visitors to your website or the number of keywords
                    you rank for. We are only motivated by how many phone calls
                    you receive, how much money you make, and whether it was
                    better than the previous quarter.

                  <h3>Why is SEO important for businesses in Baltimore? </h3>
                  <p>
                    There are a few key reasons why SEO is important for
                    businesses in Baltimore.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, local SEO can help you rank higher in search engine
                    results for searches related to your business or industry in
                    your local area. This can help you get more website visitors
                    and potential customers, which can lead to more sales and
                    revenue for your business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, SEO can help you build trust and credibility with
                    potential customers. If they see that your website is
                    ranking high for relevant searches, they’ll be more likely
                    to trust your business and consider using your products or
                    services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, SEO can help you stay ahead of the competition. If
                    your competitors are not doing SEO, you can get a leg up on
                    them by investing in SEO and getting your website to rank

                  <h3>What differentiates SEO from local SEO?</h3>
                  <p>
                    While SEO aims to increase website visibility and traffic on
                    a global scale, local SEO focuses on optimizing a website
                    for a specific geographical location, such as a city or
                    region. Local SEO strategies aim to improve search engine
                    rankings for local search queries and Google Maps results by
                    optimizing for location-specific keywords, creating local
                    business listings, and building local citations. By
                    targeting a specific geographical location, businesses can
                    attract more qualified traffic, increase visibility in local
                    search results, and improve their chances of appearing in
                    Google's Local 3-Pack.

                    When looking for an SEO company to help improve your local
                    SEO rankings, there are a few red flags to watch out for.
                    Make sure to avoid any companies that guarantee results, use
                    black hat techniques, or make unrealistic promises. Instead,
                    look for a company with a proven track record of success,
                    that uses ethical white hat techniques, and that can provide
                    a realistic plan for improving your local SEO. With the
                    right partner, you can see a significant improvement in your
                    local SEO rankings.

                    because SEO generally takes at least 6 months to show
