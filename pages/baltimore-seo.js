                <p>How?</p>
                <p>
                  Because they're buying from your competitors instead of you.

                <p>
                  Search for one of your services and see if your website

                <p>And ad costs keep getting more and more expensive.</p>
                <p>But there is a better way.</p>

            <h2>What is Baltimore SEO?</h2>
            <p>
              Baltimore SEO is search engine optimization for Baltimore
              businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              SEO is a process that helps you achieve higher rankings in the
              search engines that drive organic traffic to your site.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you rank higher in search engines, you increase your online
              visibility, attract new clients, and build trust with potential
              clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can have the best-looking website in the world, but if you
              don't optimize your site for search engines like Google, it will
              not appear on the search engine results pages (SERPs).
            </p>
            <p>
              Nobody will see your website when you don't appear on the SERPs.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you don't start doing SEO, your website may never appear in the
              search results when people search for services you offer.

                <h2>What Your Get With Our Baltimore SEO Services?</h2>

                <h3>SEO Audit</h3>
                <p>
                  First, we do an SEO audit of your current website to check for
                  optimization and identify any improvements that can be made to
                  help your business rank higher in the search results.
                </p>
                <h3>Keyword Research</h3>
                <p>
                  Once we understand your business, we research keywords that
                  people searching for businesses like yours would use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We not only want to find the right keywords, but we also want
                  to ensure there is enough search volume for those keywords and
                  that you can realistically compete for them.
                </p>
                <h3>Technical SEO</h3>
                <p>
                  After we have targeted the right keywords, we make sure your
                  website is technically sound and optimized for those keywords.
                  This process includes optimizing titles, meta tags, header
                  tags, images, and other technical aspects of the site.
                </p>
                <h3>Content Optimization</h3>
                <p>
                  Your website's content must be well-written and relevant to
                  your business if you want people to stay on your site and
                  convert into customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We optimize your website's content to ensure it is relevant to
                  the keywords we are targeting and that it is engaging and
                  informative.
                </p>
                <h3>Link Building</h3>
                <p>
                  Link building is the process of getting other websites to link
                  to your website. The more inbound links you have, the higher
                  your website will rank in the search results.

                <p>

                  so that people in your area can find your business.

                    We're not like other SEO companies in B'more that only show
                    up at the end of the month when it's time to get paid. We
                    don't hide anything from you. We keep you informed and in

                    Local SEO is the process of optimizing your website and

                    optimizing your website for specific keywords related to

                  <h3>Why is SEO important for businesses in Baltimore? </h3>
                  <p>
                    There are a few key reasons why SEO is important for
                    businesses in Baltimore. First, local SEO can help you rank
                    higher in search engine results for searches related to your
                    business or industry in your local area. This can help you
                    get more website visitors and potential customers, which can
                    lead to more sales and revenue for your business. Second,
                    SEO can help you build trust and credibility with potential
                    customers. If they see that your website is ranking high for
                    relevant searches, they’ll be more likely to trust your
                    business and consider using your products or services.
                    Finally, SEO can help you stay ahead of the competition. If
                    your competitors are not doing SEO, you can get a leg up on
                    them by investing in SEO and getting your website to rank
                    higher than theirs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, if you’re looking to boost your business in Baltimore,
                    investing in local SEO is a great place to start.

                <div className="question">
                  <h3>What is the cost of Baltimore SEO?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Baltimore SEO will cost between $1000 and $5000. The cost
                    depends on the size of your business and website, the
                    competitiveness of your industry, and the number of keywords
                    you want to target. Generally, the more keywords you want to
                    target, the higher the cost will be. Baltimore SEO is an
                    investment that can pay off handsomely, though, so it's
                    important to consider the ROI before making a decision.

                  <p>

                  <h3>What is the Difference between SEO and Local SEO?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Local SEO is focused on optimizing a website for local
                    search results, whereas SEO is focused on optimizing a
                    website for organic (non-local) search results.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are a few key differences between local SEO and SEO:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Keywords: Local SEO keywords are typically more specific
                      than general SEO keywords (e.g., "plumber in baltimore"
                      vs. "plumber").
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Search intent: Local SEO is focused on searchers who are
                      looking for local businesses, while SEO is focused on
                      searchers who may be looking for anything from local
                      businesses to general information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Location: Local SEO takes into account the searcher's
                      location, while SEO does not.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Citation building: Building local citations (i.e.,
                      mentions of your business on other websites) is a key part
                      of local SEO, while it is not as important for SEO.

                  <p>
                    When looking for an SEO company to help improve your local
                    SEO rankings, there are a few red flags to watch out for.
                    Make sure to avoid any companies that guarantee results, use
                    black hat techniques, or make unrealistic promises. Instead,
                    look for a company with a proven track record of success,
                    that uses ethical white hat techniques, and that can provide
                    a realistic plan for improving your local SEO. With the
                    right partner, you can see a significant improvement in your
                    local SEO rankings.

                    If you're willing to put in the work, you can definitely do
                    SEO yourself. However, if you want to see results more

                    because SEO generally takes at least 6 months to show

                    Website UX is all about how a website's users interact with
