            <p className="subtext">
              There are many SEO companies in Baltimore, but partnering with us
              for your SEO services has many advantages that can make a huge
              difference.

                  <h3>We are 100% Transparent</h3>
                  <p>
                    We're not like other SEO companies in B'more that only show
                    up at the end of the month when it's time to get paid. We
                    don't hide anything from you. We keep you informed and in
                    the loop about everything we do. You'll never have to ask
                    what we're doing because you'll always know.
                  </p>
                  <h3>No Long-term Contracts</h3>
                  <p>
                    We do monthly retainers, not long-term contracts. If you
                    want to stop at the end of the month, just let us know. We
                    understand that committing to an SEO campaign can be a big
                    step for a small business, but think about this. It can take
                    anywhere from three to twelve months to see any improvements
                    in your SEO performance.

                    We want you to make more money, grow your business. The
                    great thing is that when you grow, we grow with you. We
                    don't base our decisions on flimsy indicators like the
                    number of visitors to your website or the number of keywords
                    you rank for. We are only motivated by how many phone calls
                    you receive, how much money you make, and whether it was
                    better than the previous quarter.

                  <h3>Why is SEO important for businesses in Baltimore? </h3>
                  <p>
                    There are a few key reasons why SEO is important for
                    businesses in Baltimore.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First, local SEO can help you rank higher in search engine
                    results for searches related to your business or industry in
                    your local area. This can help you get more website visitors
                    and potential customers, which can lead to more sales and
                    revenue for your business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Second, SEO can help you build trust and credibility with
                    potential customers. If they see that your website is
                    ranking high for relevant searches, theyâ€™ll be more likely
                    to trust your business and consider using your products or
                    services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, SEO can help you stay ahead of the competition. If
                    your competitors are not doing SEO, you can get a leg up on
                    them by investing in SEO and getting your website to rank
                    higher than theirs.
