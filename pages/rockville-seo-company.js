                <p>You have a business in Rockville and let’s face it.</p>
                <p>You're busy.</p>
                <p>You’re too busy to learn how digital marketing works.</p>
                <p>But the thing is, you know you need it to succeed.</p>
                <p>
                  You know you need it because without digital marketing, you’ll
                  get left in the dust.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You already tried Facebook ads, Instagram ads, and even Google
                  ads, but they didn’t really bring you any business.
                </p>
                <p>Plus they're expensive.</p>
                <p>
                  You also tried paying for leads on HomeAdvisor, Angie’s List,
                  and even Thumbtack, but you’re tired of discounting your
                  prices just to compete.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other competitors in Rockville are ranking higher than you in
                  Google and their business is booming.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They’re getting more customers and more business every month.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you don’t start getting more business soon, you might have
                  to start laying off some of your employees.
                </p>
                <p>You may even have to shut down.</p>
                <p>Is that what you want?</p>
                <p>I don’t think so.</p>
                <p>
                  If you don’t do something about it now, it will only get
                  worse.

                </h2>
                <p>
                  Time to face the music - Facebook and Google ads might burn a
                  hole in your pocket as their prices continue to rise in an
                  unrelenting ascent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And if you're not careful, they could swallow your entire
                  advertising expenditure in the blink of an eye, just in
                  exchange for clicks.
                </p>
                <p>But who said you need to pay a king's ransom for ads?</p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  The answer isn't hidden in plain sight; it's called Search
                  Engine Optimization.
                </p>
                <p>
                  SEO helps you customize your website to make it more search

                    Local SEO brings your website to the attention of local
                    customers when it matters. We change how your website works
                    so that local customers find your business and not your
                    competitors. Get optimized content, a fast website, a better
                    user experience, and more so that you rank higher than
                    competitors on the first page.

                  <h3>What is SEO and how does it work?</h3>
                  <p>
                    SEO is short form for “Search engine optimization”. It is a
                    long-term marketing strategy employed in order to improve a
                    websites visibility and organic search results in google and
                    other global search engines.

                  <p>
                    SEO works by optimizing a website for Google’s algorithm.
                    The goal is to make your site rank higher in the search
                    engine results pages (SERPs). In order to do this, SEO
                    attempts to improve a websites relevancy and authority. A
                    website’s relevancy is determined by how well it covers the
                    topic that the user is searching for. Authority is
                    determined by things like inbound links, social signals, and
                    brand mentions.{' '}

                <div className="question">
                  <h3>Is SEO worth it for small business?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Yes, SEO is worth it for small business. SEO can be a very
                    effective way to grow your small business. It’s a long-term
                    strategy that can help you build your brand and get more
                    traffic and leads from Google for free.

                  <h3>How much does SEO cost in Rockville?</h3>
                  <p>
                    The monthly cost for SEO ranges from $1000 to $5,000+. The
                    cost can vary depending on the competitiveness of your
                    industry and the keywords you are targeting. Generally, SEO
                    is more affordable than PPC advertising and other forms of
                    paid marketing.

                  <h3>How long does it take for SEO to work?</h3>
                  <p>
                    The time it takes for SEO to work depends on a number of
                    factors, including the age of your website, the
                    competitiveness of your industry, and the quality of your
                    SEO efforts. In general, it takes 3-6 months for SEO to
                    start working. However, it is important to note that SEO is
                    a long-term marketing strategy, and the results you see
                    after 3-6 months are just the beginning.

                  <h3>What is better PPC or SEO?</h3>
                  <p>
                    The answer to this question depends on your goals. If you
                    are looking for immediate results, then Google Ads is the
                    better option. However, if you are looking for a long-term
                    marketing strategy that will help you build your brand and
                    get more traffic and leads from Google over time, then SEO
                    is the better option.{' '}

                  <h3>What is the Difference between SEO and Local SEO</h3>
                  <p>
                    In short, SEO (search engine optimization) is the process of
                    improving the visibility and ranking of your website in
                    search engine results pages (SERPs). Local SEO, on the other
                    hand, is focused on optimizing your website for local search
                    results.{' '}

                  <h3>How long would it take to rank my website??</h3>
                  <p>
                    The time it takes to rank a website depends on many factors,
                    including the age of the site, the competition for keywords,
                    and the quality of the site’s content. In general, it takes
                    longer to rank a new website than an established one. It
                    also takes more effort to rank for competitive keywords than
                    for less popular ones.

                    SEO is an ever-changing field, and what works today may not
                    work tomorrow. Because of this, no one can guarantee you

                    can help improve your website’s ranking in the search engine
                    results pages (SERPs).

                    sitemap so that search engines can more easily find and
                    index your site. Finally, we'll set up Google Analytics so
                    that you can track your SEO progress over time. And we may
                    have to alter the design if it is not user friendly.
