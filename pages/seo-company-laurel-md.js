                    Unlike paid advertising, which stops generating traffic once
                    you stop paying, SEO offers enduring benefits. A
                    well-optimized site can continue to rank high and attract

                  <p>
                    If your website ranks higher than your competitors in search
                    engine results, it gives you a significant advantage. This
                    prominence makes it more likely that potential customers
                    will click on your site first.
